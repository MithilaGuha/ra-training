Research Assistant Training
================

## To Do

  - Add details from the last training.
  - Figure out use of branches.
      - Permissions?
      - Push/pull issues?
  - Decide on organization or repos (data and size limits).
  - Create and clone all projects.
  - Migrate to R Markdown.
  - Update issues for each project.
  - Flesh out details for this training conditioned on the above.

## Project-Oriented Workflow

  - Using RStudio projects.
  - Safe paths (use the `here` package).
  - Beware monoliths (file naming, separate scripts like separate
    functions).
  - Naming conventions (slugs).
  - Use `output: github_document` in the YAML of R Markdown documents.
  - Discuss the use of *branches*.
